# About Berkelium Labs

**Berkelium Labs**: Explore, experiment, and discover Large Language Models (LLMs) with ease in your web browser.

## Unleash the Power of AI, Locally and Effortlessly.

Berkelium Labs was founded on a simple yet powerful idea: to democratize access to the incredible potential of Large Language Models (LLMs). We believe that exploring and experimenting with cutting-edge AI should be intuitive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background or operating system.

In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, understanding and interacting with these powerful models is becoming crucial. However, the process of downloading, configuring, and running LLMs locally has traditionally been complex, often requiring significant technical expertise and command-line wizardry.

**Berkelium Labs changes that.**

Our journey began with the exploration of a desktop application, aiming to bring local LLM experimentation to individual computers. However, driven by our core mission of universal accessibility, we’ve evolved Berkelium Labs into a platform-independent Progressive Web App (PWA). This allows us to reach a wider audience and provide a more seamless experience.

## Your Personal AI Lab, Now Without Boundaries.

Berkelium Labs PWA is designed to be your personal gateway to understanding and harnessing the power of AI, accessible directly through your web browser. Forget the complexities of installation – simply open your browser and start exploring!

**Here's what drives us:**

* **Democratizing AI:** We are passionate about breaking down the barriers that prevent individuals from engaging with and understanding advanced AI technologies.
* **Simplifying Complexity:** Our focus is on creating an intuitive and user-friendly environment that makes interacting with LLMs straightforward, even for those without deep technical knowledge.
* **Empowering Exploration:** We believe in fostering a space where anyone can experiment, learn, and discover the vast possibilities of Large Language Models.
* **Prioritizing Privacy:** Just as with our initial explorations, your privacy is paramount. With Berkelium Labs PWA, all your downloaded models, chat history, and user data remain securely stored locally on your device. You maintain complete control over your information.

## Our Evolution

Our initial development involved a desktop application, which provided valuable insights into the needs and desires of our early users. This experience has guided us in building the Berkelium Labs PWA, a more versatile and accessible platform that aligns perfectly with our vision of AI for everyone.

## More Than Just an App, It's a Gateway.

Berkelium Labs is more than just an application; it's your personal gateway to understanding and harnessing the power of AI. We've built it using robust and efficient technologies like the `@huggingface/transformers` library and `ONNX runtime` to ensure a smooth and performant experience on your local hardware.

## It's Open Source!

We are strong believers in the power of open source. Berkelium Labs is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/BerkeliumLabs/Berkelium-labs/blob/main/LICENSE), and our source code is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BerkeliumLabs/Berkelium-labs/). We encourage community contributions, feedback, and collaboration as we continue to evolve and expand the capabilities of Berkelium Labs.
