**Your personal desktop application to easily download, host, and experiment with Large Language Models (LLMs) locally.**

Berkelium Labs is an open-source desktop application designed to make the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) accessible to everyone. Built with Electron JS and an Angular frontend, it leverages the `@huggingface/transformers` library and ONNX runtime to provide a user-friendly experience for downloading, hosting, and experimenting with LLMs directly on your local machine.

**Key Features (MVP):**

* **Effortless Downloading from Hugging Face:** Browse and download a wide range of pre-trained LLMs directly from the HuggingFace Hub.
* **Simplified Local Hosting:** Host downloaded LLMs locally with a few clicks, abstracting away the backend complexities.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean and user-friendly Angular frontend for easy interaction with hosted LLMs.
* **Powered by Leading Technologies:** Utilizes `@huggingface/transformers` for model interaction and ONNX runtime for optimized performance.


**Built With:**

* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) - Framework for building cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* [Angular](https://angular.devio/) - Frontend framework for building the user interface.
* [@huggingface/transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) - Provides thousands of pre-trained models and utilities for working with them.
* [ONNX Runtime](https://onnx.ai/) - A high-performance inference engine for ONNX models, optimizing local execution.
