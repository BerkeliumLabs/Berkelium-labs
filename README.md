**Your personal AI Lab, accessible everywhere! Explore, experiment, and discover Large Language Models (LLMs) with ease in your web browser.**

Berkelium Labs has evolved from a desktop application to a platform-independent Progressive Web App (PWA) to make the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) truly accessible to everyone. Now, you can effortlessly explore, host, and experiment with LLMs directly in your web browser.

**Key Features:**

* **Instant Access, No Installation:** Access Berkelium Labs directly through your web browser on Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS etc.
* **Effortless Model Discovery:** Seamlessly browse and connect to a vast library of pre-trained LLMs on the HuggingFace Hub.
* **Simplified Local Execution (Browser-Based):** Run downloaded LLMs efficiently within your browser.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean and user-friendly Angular frontend for easy interaction with hosted LLMs.
* **Offline Capabilities:** Continue working with downloaded models and access your chat history even without a stable internet connection (PWA feature).
* **Local Data Storage:** Your downloaded models and all experimental data remain securely stored locally on your device.

**Built With:**

* [Angular](https://angular.dev/) - Frontend framework for building the user interface.
* [@huggingface/transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) - Provides thousands of pre-trained models and utilities for working with them.
* [ONNX Runtime Web](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/web.html) - A high-performance inference engine for ONNX models, optimized for web browser execution.
* [Progressive Web App (PWA) Technologies](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) - Enabling offline access and app-like experiences in the browser.

**Transition from Desktop Application:**

Berkelium Labs initially explored a desktop application to bring local LLM experimentation to users. To provide a more universal and accessible experience, we have transitioned our focus to this PWA. The desktop version is no longer under active development.
