# About Berkelium Labs

**Berkelium Labs**: Your personal desktop application to easily download, host, and experiment with Large Language Models (LLMs) locally.

## Unleash the Power of AI, Locally and Effortlessly.

Berkelium Labs was born from a simple yet powerful idea: to democratize access to the incredible potential of Large Language Models (LLMs). We believe that exploring and experimenting with cutting-edge AI should be intuitive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.

In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, understanding and interacting with these powerful models is becoming crucial. However, the process of downloading, configuring, and running LLMs locally has traditionally been complex, often requiring significant technical expertise and command-line wizardry.

**Berkelium Labs changes that.**

Our initial MVP desktop application, built with a user-friendly Angular frontend wrapped in Electron JS, streamlines the entire workflow. We're using the leading open-source AI hub, [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), to bring their vast repository of pre-trained models directly to your fingertips. With Berkelium Labs, you can:

* **Effortlessly Discover and Download:** Browse and download from thousands of LLMs on the HuggingFace Hub with a simple, integrated interface. No more manual downloads or confusing setup processes.
* **Host Locally with One Click:** Run these powerful models directly on your own computer with unparalleled ease. Berkelium Labs handles the technical complexities in the background, allowing you to focus on experimentation.
* **Experiment with an Intuitive Interface:** Our clean and thoughtfully designed user interface makes interacting with LLMs a breeze. Whether you're generating creative text, answering complex questions, or exploring the nuances of language models, Berkelium Labs provides a comfortable and efficient environment.

## More Than Just an App, It's a Gateway.

Berkelium Labs is more than just a desktop application; it's your personal gateway to understanding and harnessing the power of AI. We've built it using robust and efficient technologies like the `@huggingface/transformers` library and ONNX runtime to ensure a smooth and performant experience on your local hardware.

## It's Open Source!

We are strong believers in the power of open source. Berkelium Labs is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/BerkeliumLabs/Berkeliumlabs-studio/blob/main/LICENSE), and our source code is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BerkeliumLabs/Berkeliumlabs-studio/). We encourage community contributions, feedback, and collaboration as we continue to evolve and expand the capabilities of Berkelium Labs.
