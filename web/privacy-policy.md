## 4. Data Sharing with Google

The information collected by Google Analytics is transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. Google may also share this information with third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google's use and sharing of this data are governed by the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 5. Your Choices Regarding Analytics

You may be able to control the collection and use of your data by Google Analytics through the following methods:

- **Browser Add-ons:** Google provides a browser add-on that allows you to opt-out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you visit. You can download this add-on here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
- **Browser Settings:** Most web browsers allow you to control cookies and other tracking technologies. Please refer to your browser's help documentation for instructions on how to manage these settings.

## 6. Local Storage Usage

Berkelium Labs utilizes your browser's local storage to:

- Temporarily store downloaded Large Language Models to improve loading times during your current session.
- Persist your chat history and configuration settings so you can resume your work even if you close and reopen the app later on the same device.

**This data stored in your browser's local storage is only accessible by Berkelium Labs running in that specific browser on your device.** We do not have access to this local storage.

## 7. Third-Party Services

Berkelium Labs interacts with the HuggingFace Hub to allow you to browse and download pre-trained Large Language Models. While we facilitate this connection, **Berkelium Labs does not send any of your personal information to HuggingFace.** Your interaction with the HuggingFace is subject to their own privacy policy, which we encourage you to review.

## 8. Data Security

While we strive to protect the information we collect (through Google Analytics), please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. However, the core functionality and your personal AI interactions remain local and are not transmitted to us.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Berkelium Labs is intended for general use and is not specifically directed towards children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children.
